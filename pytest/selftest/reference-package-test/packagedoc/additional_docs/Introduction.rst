The Python package ``ReferencePackage`` is a reference package to test the documentation tool chain.

This reference package contains a set of Python source files, files in rst format (= **r**\ e **s**\ tructured **t**\ ext)
and files in LaTeX format, that contain all layout elements that can be used for documentation:

* headlines
* links to files on external web servers
* imported pictures
* tables in rst format
* certain LaTeX styles (e.g. syntax highlighting for Robot Framework code and Python code, several admonitions)

The purpose is mostly to check manually - by simply taking a look at the content of the PDF output -, if all layout elements work properly.
If it is possible and makes sense, later some tests might be automated also.

The reference package is part of the tests of the build repository and can be found here:

   `reference-package-test <https://gitlab-apertispro.boschdevcloud.com/robotframework-aio/main/build/test/reference-package-test>`_

The output - the generated PDF documentation - can be found here:

   `ReferencePackage.pdf <https://gitlab-apertispro.boschdevcloud.com/robotframework-aio/main/build/test/reference-package-test/ReferencePackage/ReferencePackage.pdf>`_
